# A collision experiment in JavaScript
This is an example of collision Detection with Javascript <canvas>.
The animation rests at the bottom, and shows the coordinates as each image is drawn.  On collision the table reference 'collision' will read true, while when the image is not beyond the set range, it will read false.
  
## Tables
The javascript class that returns the values in the top two tables just uses Math.abs() to check if the x values or y values intersect within a given range.
